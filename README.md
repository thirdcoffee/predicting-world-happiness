## Introduction

Happiness is an important aspect of human well-being and has been the subject of numerous studies. This project focuses on predicting world happiness scores using machine learning algorithms. By examining various socio-economic factors we aim to create a predictive model that can estimate the happiness level of a country.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the World Happiness Report, which contains happiness scores and various indicators for 156 countries. The data is collected annually and provides a comprehensive view of the factors that contribute to happiness. The dataset can be found [here](https://worldhappiness.report).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdcoffee/predicting-world-happiness.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd predicting-world-happiness
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook

## Methodology

This project follows a standard machine learning pipeline. The steps involved are:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the raw dataset to prepare it for modeling.

2. Feature selection: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to happiness prediction.

3. Model training: Building and training a machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.

4. Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

5. Prediction: Applying the trained model to predict happiness scores for new data.

## Results

The results of this project include the trained model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, mean squared error, and R-squared value. These metrics indicate how well the model predicts happiness scores based on the selected features.
